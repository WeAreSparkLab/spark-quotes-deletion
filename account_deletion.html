    <h1>Account Deletion for Spark Quotes</h1>
    <p>This page provides information on how to delete your account and associated data for the <strong>Spark Quotes</strong> app, developed by **WeAreSparkLab**.</p>

    <h2>How to Request Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>We offer two ways to request the deletion of your Spark Quotes account and all associated personal data:</p>

    <h3>1. Within the Spark Quotes App:</h3>
    <p>We are actively working on implementing a direct account deletion feature within the Spark Quotes app itself. Once available, you will find a "Delete Account" button or option typically located in the app's settings or profile section. Follow the in-app prompts to confirm your request.</p>

    <h3>2. Via Email Request:</h3>
    <p>You can request account deletion by sending an email to our dedicated support team. This method is available now and allows you to initiate the deletion process even if you have uninstalled the app.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> <a href="mailto:we.are.spark.lab.official@gmail.com">we.are.spark.lab.official@gmail.com</a></li>
        <li><strong>In your email, please include:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The **email address** associated with your Spark Quotes account.</li>
                <li>A clear statement requesting **"Spark Quotes Account and Data Deletion"**.</li>
                <li>(Optional) Any feedback or reason for deletion you'd like to provide (this helps us improve).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will verify your request and process it as quickly as possible, typically within 7-10 business days. You will receive a confirmation email once your account and data have been successfully deleted.</p>

    <h2>What Data is Deleted and What is Kept?</h2>
    <p>When your Spark Quotes account is deleted, we will permanently remove all personal data directly associated with your account from our active databases. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your user account information (email, username, etc.)</li>
        <li>Any quotes you have saved or created within the app that are linked to your account.</li>
        <li>Any usage data that can be directly tied back to your individual account.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may retain certain aggregated or anonymized data that cannot be linked back to you, for analytical purposes (e.g., total number of quotes created, general app usage trends). Additionally, we may retain certain data for a limited period if legally required (e.g., for tax or audit purposes) or for legitimate business purposes such as fraud prevention, as outlined in our <a href="[Link to your full Privacy Policy here, if you have one]">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>Thank you for using Spark Quotes.</p>
    <p>The WeAreSparkLab Team</p>
